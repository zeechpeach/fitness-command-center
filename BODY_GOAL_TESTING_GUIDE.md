   - Body goal fields pre-populate with saved values
   - Goal display shows current data
   - Calorie targets show in Nutrition tab

### 7. Mobile Responsiveness

#### Test Case 7.1: Mobile View (< 768px)
1. Resize browser to mobile width or use DevTools mobile emulation
2. Navigate through tabs
3. **Expected Results**:
   - Goal input fields stack vertically
   - Calorie breakdown items stack vertically
   - All buttons remain accessible (min 44px height)
   - Text remains readable
   - No horizontal scrolling needed

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ All body goal selections save to Firebase and persist  
‚úÖ Weight logging triggers automatic calorie recalculation  
‚úÖ 7-day moving average smooths daily fluctuations  
‚úÖ Progress tracking accurately reflects goal status  
‚úÖ Goal end dates calculate correctly for cutting/bulking  
‚úÖ Maintaining goal alerts for ¬±3 lbs deviation  
‚úÖ Calorie targets update in real-time  
‚úÖ Mobile layout is fully responsive  
‚úÖ Input validation prevents invalid data  
‚úÖ All existing features remain functional  

## Known Limitations

- Calorie targets only appear when both goal AND weight data exist
- Moving average requires at least 1 weight entry (will show single value until 7 entries exist)
- Firebase must be accessible for all features to work

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Calorie Target card doesn't appear  
**Solution**: Ensure you have both a body goal set AND at least one weight entry logged

**Issue**: Progress indicator always shows "Set your goal to track progress"  
**Solution**: Make sure all three goal fields are filled (Goal Type, Target Weight, Goal Start Date)

**Issue**: Changes don't persist after refresh  
**Solution**: Check browser console for Firebase connection errors

**Issue**: 7-Day Moving Average shows "-- lbs"  
**Solution**: Log at least one weight entry to see the moving average
