## Tasks Completed

### 1. Progress Photos Delete Functionality ‚úÖ
**Location**: Lines 984-1011 (CSS), 4136-4155 (JavaScript), 4165-4167 (Render)

**Changes**:
- Added `.btn-delete-photo` CSS class for delete button overlay

  - Styling: Red background `rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.9)`, white text
  - Hover effect: Full opacity and scale(1.1)
  - Z-index: 10 to stay above image

- Created `window.deleteProgressPhoto(photoId)` function
  - Confirmation dialog: "Delete this progress photo?"
  - Firebase deletion: `deleteDoc(doc(db, "photos", photoId))`
  - Local array update: `window.photoData = window.photoData.filter(p => p.id !== photoId)`
  - Re-render gallery: `renderPhotos()`
  - Error handling with console.error and user alert

- Updated `renderPhotos()` function
  - Added delete button to each photo item: `<button class="btn-delete-photo" onclick="deleteProgressPhoto('${photo.id}')" title="Delete photo">üóëÔ∏è</button>`

### 2. Session Comparison Enhancement ‚úÖ
**Location**: Lines 2938-3137 (updateSessionComparison function)

**Changes Removed**:
- ‚ùå "Exercises" count for both sessions
- ‚ùå "Avg Weight" for both sessions
- ‚ùå `calculateAvgWeight` helper function

**Changes Kept**:
- ‚úÖ Volume totals for both sessions
- ‚úÖ Volume change with percentage
- ‚úÖ "Improving/Declining" indicator
- ‚úÖ Date stamps for both sessions

**New Additions**:
- Exercise-by-exercise comparison logic
  - Compares max weight√óreps between sessions
  - Tracks increased, decreased exercises
  - Detects plateaued exercises (3+ sessions)

- **Increased section** (green)
  - Color: `#10b981`
  - Shows exercises with improvements
  - Format: `‚Ä¢ Exercise: weight√óreps ‚Üí weight√óreps`

- **Decreased section** (red)
  - Color: `#ef4444`
  - Shows exercises with declines
  - Format: `‚Ä¢ Exercise: weight√óreps ‚Üí weight√óreps`

- **Plateaued section** (orange)
  - Color: `#f59e0b`
  - Shows exercises stuck for 3+ sessions
  - Format: `‚Ä¢ Exercise: weight√óreps`
  - Only shown if workouts.length >= 3

### 3. Intensity Heatmap Calculation Fix ‚úÖ
**Location**: Lines 3045-3056 (calculation), 3093-3095 (display text)

**Changes**:
- **Fixed formula**:
  ```javascript
  // OLD (incorrect):
  (10 - (intensity.fatigue || 0))
  
  // NEW (correct):
  (6 - (intensity.fatigue || 1))
  // Fatigue 1 ‚Üí 5, Fatigue 5 ‚Üí 1
  ```

- **Added scaling**:
  ```javascript
  const scaledScore = (avgScore / 5) * 10;
  ```

- **Updated display text**:
  - OLD: "Average intensity score (0-10) based on energy, motivation, fatigue, and satisfaction"
  - NEW: "Intensity score (0-10) - calculated from your 1-5 ratings. Fatigue is inverted (lower fatigue = higher score)."

### 4. Progression Snapshot Clarity ‚úÖ
**Location**: Lines 1863-1875 (HTML), 3220-3245 (JavaScript)

**HTML Changes**:
- Quick Wins: "Complete at least 2 workouts to see recent PRs"
- Trending Up: Added helper text "Improving over last 4 sessions"
- Needs Attention: Added helper text "No progress for 3+ sessions"

**JavaScript Changes**:
- Trending Up placeholder: "Need 3+ sessions per exercise to detect trends"
- Needs Attention: Already shows "All exercises progressing well! üí™" when no plateaus

### 5. Insights Correlation Analysis ‚úÖ
**Location**: Lines 2718-2865 (generateAIInsights function)

**New Features**:

#### Data Requirements Check
- Minimum 5 workouts
- Minimum 5 nutrition days
- Minimum 5 weight entries
- Returns early with basic insights if insufficient data

#### Strength vs Weight Correlation
Compares last 2 weeks vs prior 2 weeks:
- Volume change percentage
- Weight change in pounds
- Generates contextual insights:
  - "Your strength is up X% while weight increased Ylbs - excellent lean mass gains!"
  - "Strength maintaining while weight down Ylbs - good cutting progress"
  - "Weight stable but strength up X% - great recomp!"
  - "Strength declining X% while weight down Ylbs - may need more calories"

#### Nutrition Adequacy
Analyzes last 14 days:
- Calculates average protein on workout days
- Compares with workout frequency
- Generates insights:
  - "Averaging Xg protein/day with Y workouts/week - optimal for growth"
  - "Only Xg protein on workout days - consider increasing to 0.8-1g per lb bodyweight"
  - "Great job hitting Xg+ protein on training days"

#### Recovery Indicators
Correlates intensity ratings with volume changes:
- Requires minimum 6 workouts for volume comparison
- Calculates average energy, fatigue, satisfaction scores
- Generates insights:
  - "Low energy scores (avg X/5) last week but volume still up - good mental toughness"
  - "High fatigue scores correlate with X% volume drop - consider deload week"
  - "Satisfaction scores averaging X/5 - training is going well!"

#### Debug Logging
Added console.log statements as requested:
- Volume change percentage
- Weight change in pounds
- Average protein and workout frequency
- Recent intensity metrics (energy, fatigue, satisfaction)

## Code Quality Improvements

### Safety Checks
- ‚úÖ Division by zero protection in volume calculations (requires 6+ workouts)
- ‚úÖ Null/undefined checks for all data arrays
- ‚úÖ Default values for missing intensity data
- ‚úÖ Proper fatigue inversion: `(6 - (intensity.fatigue || 1))`

### Error Handling
- ‚úÖ Try-catch blocks in deleteProgressPhoto
- ‚úÖ User-friendly error messages
- ‚úÖ Console.error for debugging

### Code Consistency
- ‚úÖ Matches existing Firebase patterns
- ‚úÖ Consistent styling with app theme
- ‚úÖ Mobile responsive (existing grid layouts)
- ‚úÖ Same button styling as food delete buttons

## Testing Notes

- No automated tests to run
- Manual testing required by user
- Basic syntax validation passed
- Brace and tag balance verified

- CSS classes added: 2 (.btn-delete-photo, .btn-delete-photo:hover)

## Security Summary
- ‚úÖ No security vulnerabilities introduced
- ‚úÖ Proper Firebase authentication assumed (existing pattern)
- ‚úÖ Input validation for all user data

6. Verify mobile responsiveness on various devices
7. Check Firebase permissions for photo deletion
