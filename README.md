## Workout Schedule Cycle

The application follows a 7-day repeating workout schedule:

1. **Upper** - Upper body focus (chest, back, shoulders, arms)
2. **Lower** - Lower body focus (legs, glutes)
3. **Rest** - Recovery day
4. **Push** - Push muscles (chest, shoulders, triceps)
5. **Pull** - Pull muscles (back, biceps)
6. **Legs** - Legs focus (quads, hamstrings, calves)
7. **Rest** - Recovery day

The cycle automatically repeats, and the calendar shows which workout is scheduled for each day.

## Exercise Approach Variations

For each exercise, you can select different approaches without affecting progressive overload tracking:

- **Standard**: Normal training approach
- **Heavy**: Lower reps with heavier weight for power development
- **Form Focus**: Lighter weight emphasizing technique and mind-muscle connection
- **Alt Exercise**: Substitute with an alternative exercise when traveling or equipment is unavailable

These variations are tagged and saved with your workout data for future reference.

## Data Storage

All data is stored in Firebase Firestore with the following collections:

- **workouts**: Exercise data, sets, reps, weights, intensity ratings
- **nutrition**: Meals, foods, macros, calories
- **weight**: Daily weight entries
- **photos**: Progress photos with dates
